                <h2>Difference between Local Storage and Session Storage</h2>
                <p><b>Local Storage:</b> This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local
                    storage
                    object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that
                    localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is
                    cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed. DOMStrings are storage formats that use
                    UTF-16 to
                    encode data, which uses two bytes per character. Strings are automatically generated from integer
                    keys just as they are for objects. The data stored in LocalStorage is specific to a protocol in the
                    document. If the site is loaded over HTTP, localStorage returns a
                    different object than if it is loaded over HTTPS.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Session Storage:</b> Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only
                    property. The difference
                    between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas
                    sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

                    A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are
                    valid for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or the
                    browser is open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new session is created
                    each time a tab or window is opened; this is different from session cookies. Each tab/window that is
                    opened with the same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a tab, the sessionStorage
                    from the original tab is copied to the duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and
                    clears sessionStorage objects.

                <h2>Difference between Global Scope and Session Scope</h2>
                <p> <b>Global Scope:</b> The Javascript global scope is the context where everything in a Javascript
                    program executes by
                    default. This scope includes all variables, objects, and references that are not contained
                    within a customized scope defined by a programmer. Global scope is the entire Javascript
                    execution environment.</p>
                <p> <b>Session Scope:</b> Session Scopes are can also be accessed from anywhere in the application, but
                    they are different
                    for different users, since they depend on the session. They die when a particular user session ends.

                <h2>Event Loop of JavaScript</h2>
                <p>The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations
                    on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of
                    multi-threading. Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end.
                    The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed.
                    Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack. The event queue is responsible for
                    sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain
                    the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Variable that is not initialized will give undefined.</li>
                    <li>Function with no returns.</li>
                    <li>Parameter that is not passed will be undefined.</li>
                    <li>If return has nothing on the right side will return undefined.</li>
                    <li>Property that doesn't exixts on an object will give undefined.</li>
                    <li>Accessing array elements outside of the index range.</li>
                    <li>Deleting an element inside an array.</li>
                    <li>Set a value directly to undefined.</li>
